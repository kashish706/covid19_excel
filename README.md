🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis – India 
📘 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Excel-based dashboard that visualizes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across Indian states and union territories. 
The dashboard was created as part of my B.Tech CSE coursework for the INT217 course.
By using Microsoft Excel’s powerful features like PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers, and Map Charts, the dashboard enables users to explore trends in 
confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, testing rates, and vaccination progress — all in an interactive and user-friendly format.

🎯 Key Objectives
1. Visualize Confirmed COVID-19 Cases Over Time by State
2. Identify the Top 10 Most Affected States
3. Compare Testing and Vaccination Progress Across States
4. Analyze Vaccination Coverage: People Vaccinated vs Fully Vaccinated
5. Display the Geographic Spread of COVID-19 Using Map Chart
